Project Name: NBANLP: Natural Language Generation of NBA Game Recap Articles
by Jacob Bustamante

Dependencies:
Python3.
BeautifulSoup4. Can be downloaded from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup
SQLite3. Should be included in most systems, but can be downloaded from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

How to run:

1) Unzip scrapers/scrapers.zip into its current directory.
	This will create a directory named "onetwosee_season_2014" in the scrapers directory.
	Ex) /scrapers/onetwosee_season_2014/

2) Run the gen_recap.py file using Python3:
	Python3 gen_recap.py

3.1) Enter a number, a list of numbers, or "ALL" to generate an article for those games.
	ex1) Select games between 1 and 1225…: 2
	ex2) Select games between 1 and 1225…: 4 5 8 10
	ex3) Select games between 1 and 1225…: ALL
3.2) Enter "Partial" to generate an article for part of a game.
	ex1) Enter [quarter minutes seconds]: 3 1 47
	ex2) Enter [quarter minutes seconds]: 4 0 0
3.3) Enter "IMPORT" to import scraped data files into the NBA Database.
	Note: The current build includes a pre-filled database, so this is unnecessary unless you are using different data.
	Note: "Games" are individual date files per game. "Game Schedules" are data files per day of all the games taking place that day.
3.4) Enter "SCRAPE" to scrape data files over the Internet onto your local machine.
	Note: The current build includes all pre-scraped data for the 2014-2015 NBA regular season, so this is unnecessary unless you are using different data.
	Note: Scraping schedule data downloads all "Game Schedules" for the 2014-2015 regular NBA season. Scraping "Games" downloads all the games found in the schedules table of the local sqlite NBA Database.

4) The resulting articles are output as HTML files in the /web/2014_season directory.
	Note: The /web/2014_season directory is pre-populated with 1225 generated game recap articles, but these can be safely deleted if you want to run the program yourself. The recap generator will also overwrite an existing article.
	Note: The images in the /web/img directory belong to their own respective owners and are only being used for educational purposes.
